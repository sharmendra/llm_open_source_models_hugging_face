# Hugging Face NLP and Audio Processing Tasks

This guide provides instructions to set up and use various NLP and audio processing tasks with Hugging Face models and supporting libraries.

---

## 001 - Translation and Summarization

Perform tasks like text translation (e.g., English to French) and text summarization (e.g., condensing large text into a summary).

### Installation:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install torch
```

---

## 002 - Sentence Embeddings

Generate vector representations of sentences for tasks like semantic similarity and clustering.

### Installation:

```bash
pip install SentenceTransformer
```

---

## 003 - Zero-Shot Audio Classification

Classify audio files into categories without explicit training on those categories using pre-trained models.

### Installation:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install soundfile
pip install librosa
```

---

## 004 - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Convert spoken language in audio files into text using pre-trained ASR models.

### Installation:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install -U datasets
pip install soundfile
pip install librosa
pip install gradio
```

---

## 005 - Text-To-Speech (TTS)

Convert input text into spoken audio using Hugging Face models and supporting libraries.

### Installation:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install gradio
pip install timm
pip install inflect
pip install phonemizer
```

---

### Key Notes:

1. **Hugging Face Tools**:

   - The `transformers` library provides access to pre-trained models for all these tasks.
   - The `datasets` library is used for efficient data handling and processing.

2. **Supporting Libraries**:

   - `SentenceTransformer` for sentence embeddings.
   - `soundfile` and `librosa` for audio processing.
   - `gradio` for building interactive web interfaces.
   - `inflect` and `phonemizer` for improving text-to-speech accuracy.

3. **Applications**:
   - Translation, summarization, embeddings, zero-shot classification, ASR, and TTS are foundational for building advanced NLP and audio processing applications.
